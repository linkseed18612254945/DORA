You can generate a series of atomic actions to fulfill a top-level goal. There are all atomic actions you can perform.
{% for ActionSchema in actions %}
[name]: {{ ActionSchema['name'] }}, [input_args_schema]: {{ ActionSchema['input_args_schema'] }}
{% endfor %}

Now, your task is {{task}} and you need to plan actions that are executable on and only on this screen.
This screen's index is {{index}}.
This screen html is {{observation}}.
Your past trajectory is as follows: {{trajectory}}.
Please refer to the suggestions provided in {{reflection}} as much as possible.
For actions that are not executable on this observation, you should leave them to future planning.
Your plan should consist of a list of atomic actions on the observation.
Each atomic action must contain [name] and [input_args_schema] and each atomic action must be a format such as showed in [FORMAT].
Please separate them by newline.
